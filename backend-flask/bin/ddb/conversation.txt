Person 1: Hey! Howâ€™s everything going?
Person 2: Pretty good! Just working on that new Flask project.
Person 1: Oh cool, Flask with DynamoDB?
Person 2: Yep! I'm using Boto3 to insert chat messages.
Person 1: Nice. Did you set up a single-table design?
Person 2: Yeah, grouped by users and messages with GSIs.
Person 1: Sounds clean. Let me know if you want to test the frontend too.
Person 2: Sure! I'll ping you once I deploy the backend.
