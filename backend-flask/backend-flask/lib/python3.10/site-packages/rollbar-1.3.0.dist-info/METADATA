## Python Versions Supported

| PyRollbar Version | Python Version Compatibility                  | Support Level       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1.3.0             | 3.7. 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13         | Full                |
| 0.16.3            | 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7. 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 | Security Fixes Only |

#### Support Level Definitions

**Full** - We will support new features of the library and test against all supported versions.

**Security Fixes Only** - We will only provide critical security fixes for the library.

## Frameworks Supported

Generally, PyRollbar can be used with any Python framework. However, we have official support for the following frameworks:

| Framework | Support Duration           | Tested Versions |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Celery    | Release +1 year            | None            |
| Django    | Release or LTS end +1 year | 4.2, 5.1        |
| FastAPI   | Release +1 year            | 0.110, 0.115    |
| Flask     | Release +1 year            | 1.1, 2.3, 3.1   |
| Pyramid   | Release +1 year            | 1.10, 2.0       |

Official support means that we ship and maintain integrations for these frameworks. It also means that we test against these frameworks as part of our CI pipeline.

Generally, we will support the last year of releases for a framework. If a framework has a defined support period (including LTS releases), we will support the release for the duration of that period plus one year.

### Community Supported

There are also a number of community-supported integrations available. For more information, see the [Python SDK docs](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/python-community-supported-sdks).
